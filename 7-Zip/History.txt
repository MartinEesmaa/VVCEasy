24.07          2024-06-19
-------------------------
- The bug was fixed: 7-Zip could crash for some incorrect ZSTD archives.


24.06          2024-05-26
-------------------------
- The bug was fixed: 7-Zip could not unpack some ZSTD archives.


24.05          2024-05-14
-------------------------
- New switch -myv={MMNN} to set decoder compatibility version for 7z archive creating.
  {MMNN} is 4-digit number that represents the version of 7-Zip without a dot.
  If -myv={MMNN} switch is specified, 7-Zip will only use compression methods that can
  be decoded by the specified version {MMNN} of 7-Zip and newer versions.
  If -myv={MMNN} switch is not specified, -myv=2300 is used, and 7-Zip will only
  use compression methods that can be decoded by 7-Zip 23.00 and newer versions.
- New switch -myfa={FilterID} to    allow 7-Zip to use the specified filter method for 7z archive creating.
- New switch -myfd={FilterID} to disallow 7-Zip to use the specified filter method for 7z archive creating.
- Some bugs were fixed.


24.04          2024-04-05
-------------------------
- New menu item in 7-Zip File Manager: "Tools / Delete Temporary Files...".
  This menu item opens a window showing temporary folders and files
  created by 7-Zip in the user's "Temp" folder on a Windows system.
  In this window, the user can delete temporary files.


24.03          2024-03-23
-------------------------
- 7-Zip now can use new RISCV filter for compression to 7z and xz archives.
  RISCV filter can increase compression ratio for data containing executable
  files compiled for RISC-V architecture.
- The speed for LZMA and LZMA2 decompression in ARM64 version for Windows
  was increased by 20%-60%.
- 7-Zip GUI and 7-Zip File Manager can ask user permission to unpack RAR archives that
  require big amount of memory, if the dictionary size in RAR archive is larger than 4 GB.
- new switch -smemx{size}g : to set allowed memory usage limit for RAR archive unpacking.
  RAR archives can use dictionary up 64 GB. Default allowed limit for RAR unpacking is 4 GB.
- 7zg.exe (7-Zip GUI): -y switch disables user requests and messages.
- 7-Zip shows hash methods XXH64 and BLAKE2sp in context menu.
- -slmu switch : to show timestamps as UTC instead of LOCAL TIME.
- -slsl switch : in console 7-Zip for Windows : to show file paths with
  linux path separator slash '/' instead of backslash separator '\'.
- 7-Zip supports .sha256 files that use backslash path separator '\'.
- Some bugs were fixed.


24.01          2024-01-31
-------------------------
- 7-Zip now can unpack ZSTD archives (.zst filename extension).
- 7-Zip now can unpack ZIP, SquashFS and RPM archives that use ZSTD compression method.
- 7-Zip now supports fast hash algorithm XXH64 that is used in ZSTD.
- 7-Zip now can unpack RAR archives (that use larger than 4 GB dictionary) created by new WinRAR 7.00.
- 7-Zip now can unpack DMG archives that use XZ (ULMO/LZMA) compression method.
- 7-Zip now can unpack NTFS images with cluster size larger than 64 KB.
- 7-Zip now can unpack MBR and GPT images with 4 KB sectors.
- Speed optimizations for archive unpacking: rar, cab, wim, zip, gz.
- Speed optimizations for hash caclulation: CRC-32, CRC-64, BLAKE2sp.
- The bug was fixed: 7-Zip for Linux could fail for multivolume creation in some cases.
- Some bugs were fixed.


23.01          2023-06-20
-------------------------
- The page "Language" in 7-Zip's menu Tools/Options now shows information
  about selected translation, including the number of translated lines.
- Some bugs were fixed.


23.00          2023-05-07
-------------------------
- 7-Zip now can use new ARM64 filter for compression to 7z and xz archives.
  ARM64 filter can increase compression ratio for data containing executable
  files compiled for ARM64 (AArch64) architecture.
  Also 7-Zip now parses executable files (that have exe and dll filename extensions)
  before compressing, and it selects appropriate filter for each parsed file:
    - BCJ or BCJ2 filter for x86 executable files,
    - ARM64 filter for ARM64 executable files.
  Previous versions by default used x86 filter BCJ or BCJ2 for all exe/dll files.
- Default section size for BCJ2 filter was changed from 64 MiB to 240 MiB.
  It can increase compression ratio for executable files larger than 64 MiB.
- UDF: support was improved.
- cpio: support for hard links.
- Some changes and optimizations in WIM creation code.
- When new 7-Zip creates multivolume archive, 7-Zip keeps in open state
  only volumes that still can be changed. Previous versions kept all volumes
  in open state until the end of the archive creation.
- 7-Zip for Linux and macOS now can reduce the number of simultaneously open files,
  when 7-Zip opens, extracts or creates multivolume archive. It allows to avoid
  the failures for cases with big number of volumes, bacause there is a limitation
  for number of open files allowed for a single program in Linux and macOS.
- There are optimizations in code for 7-Zip's context menu in Explorer:
  the speed of preparing of the menu showing was improved for cases when big number of
  files were selected by external program for context menu that contains 7-Zip menu commands.
- There are changes in code for the drag-and-drop operations to and from 7-Zip File Manager.
  And the drag-and-drop operation with right button of mouse now is supported for some cases.
- The bugs were fixed:
  - ZIP archives: if multithreaded zip compression was performed with more than one
      file to stdout stream (-so switch), 7-Zip didn't write "data descriptor" for some files.
  - ext4 archives: 7-Zip couldn't correctly extract symbolic link to directory from ext4 archives.
  - HFS and APFS archives: 7-Zip incorrectly decoded uncompressed blocks (64 KiB) in compressed forks.
  - HFS : zlib without Adler supported
  - Some another bugs were fixed.
