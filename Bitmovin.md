# Bitmovin VVDec Player (instructions of encode segments)

If you want to put your VVC file into Bitmovin VvDec Player, we need add `--segment`, `-f` as frames and `-fs` as frame skip into vvencapp.

Otherwise, if you put VVC file (which is all together of one file) without segments, your application might freeze your computer and application too.

To make probably decoded well for segments, here is an example of this:

Example of code (1 second/24 frames). After first segment (1 sec), it will go up 1 second (total frames 48):
```
vvencapp --qp 34 -i out.yuv -s 854x480 -r 24 --preset slow --threads 16 --tier high --segment mid -f 24 -fs 24 -o EXTREME-1.266
```

First segment (first) will be beginning from video, 0 sec -> 1 sec. (segment-0.vvc)

Middle segment (mid) will be during from video, 1 sec -> 2 sec. (segment-1.vvc)

Last segment (last) will be ending from video, 2 sec -> 3 sec. (segment-2.vvc)

Total is three seconds and three segments. Example of my segments, including log:

Want to build VVDec (.dll (Windows)/.dylib (Mac OS)/.so (Linux)) yourself?

Here is a code:

```
git clone https://github.com/fraunhoferhhi/vvdec.git
cd vvdec
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=1 ..
cmake --build . --config Release
```

The build files might be vvdec/bin/release-shared

Windows: vvdec.dll

Mac OS: libvvdec.dylib

Linux: libvvdecLib.so

***Note to Linux: If the file (.so) can't load into your Bitmovin VVDec Player. You have to rename libvvdec.so into libvvdecLib.so***
