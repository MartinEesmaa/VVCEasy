# LAV Filters for Windows (VVC version)

LAV Filters is an open source of Windows DirectShow filters with splitter and decoder for FFmpeg.

For VVC version, it is included external VVC decoder libvvdec and xHE-AAC with LAV Filters and can be played by any DirectShow players, but it requires Windows Vista and later.

To install LAV Filters VVC version on your computer, you need right click and run as administrator for batchfiles (.BAT file).

Original source code: https://github.com/Nevcairiel/LAVFilters

Update: Please note, this is experimental. It needs to be fixed for modifying LAVFilter source code. I'll try to figure it out to make it work.
