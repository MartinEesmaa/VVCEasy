<h1 align="center">VVCEasy by Martin Eesmaa</h1>

VVCEasy is that you don't have to compile or/and coding to encode VVC (known as Versatile Video Codec). Simple, Easy, Encode and Decode.

It supports Windows, macOS, Linux, BSD, Android & WebAssembly for VVCEasy builds.

From October 20, 2021, to June 23, 2022, VVCEasy was in pre-release and construction mode.

Since June 23, 2022, VVCEasy was initially released at version 1.0.0.

VVCEasy comes with one easy command, utilizing FFmpeg-VVC, Fraunhofer HHI VVC binaries, uvg266, MPV, LAVFilters, and MPC-HC & MPC-BE, among other features.

Installation: Go to the releases and download the latest version.

Windows source run (Batch-file) (for encoding/decoding, it needs to be manually edit batchfile to modify video file name): [VVCEasy.bat](VVCEasy.bat)

Windows/Mac/Linux source run (C#): Bin/Release or Debug/netX.x/VVCEasy.exe (after building the C# project), which requires VVCEasy.dll to run the console application.

# Compile for VVCEasy

### VVCEasy Batchfile Version (optional) (Windows only)

First, before compiling to VVCEasy Batchfile Version, you need to install Inno Setup to compile it.
Inno Setup link: https://jrsoftware.org/isdl.php

Step 1: Clone VVCEasy git and open up VVCEasy_compiler.iss file
```
cd %userprofile%\Downloads
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/MartinEesmaa/VVCEasy && cd VVCEasy
VVCEasy_compiler.iss
```

Step 2: Press F9 on your keyboard to compile. After compiling, VVCEasy.exe (Installer) can be found in the Install folder.

![VVCEasyclickblueplaybutton](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88035011/153736303-b0949f5a-5ac5-4123-92c5-305211a8aadc.png)

---

### VVCEasy .NET Console Version (optional)

You need .NET SDK from Microsoft.
Link: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download

Step 1: Clone git and cd VVCEasy
```
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/MartinEesmaa/VVCEasy && cd VVCEasy
```

Step 2: Start building the project by command:
```
dotnet build -c Release
```

Step 3: Once build is done, the result folder directory is bin/Release
```
cd bin/Release
```

> [!TIP]
> *You can run VVCEasy without building.*
```
dotnet run
```

### Publish single .NET binary executable

If you want to compile and publish it into a portable executable file, you can do so if you wish.
```
dotnet publish -c Release
```

After that, it can be found for example at bin\Release\netX.x\win-x64\publish.

# GUI applications (easy)

If you're not familiar with using the CLI, you can use a GUI with an application window for ease of use, eliminating the need to type commands in your terminal.

These VVC programs for encoding/decoding are listed:

| Programs with website or GitHub link | Note | Creator
--- | --- | --- |
[Fastflix](https://github.com/cdgriffith/FastFlix) | You might need to download my custom FFmpeg builds for encoding/decoding VVC using external libraries, rename to ffmpeg.exe and ffprobe.exe from my custom names only, no ffplay executable file required | Chris Griffith
[VVC-GUI-Encoder](https://github.com/Disa-Kizonda/VVC-GUI-Encoder) | Only encoder | Disa Kizonda
[aVVCator](https://github.com/gianni-rosato/aVVCator) | Only encoder & Linux only | Gianni Rosato
[VVenCguiEx](https://github.com/rigaya/VVenCguiEx) | Original Japanese language only for instructions and application (you can still translate), only encoder & Windows only, requires Aviutl (this may be medium or hard) | rigaya
[VVConvert](https://vvconvert.app/) | Only encoder, encodes to VVC raw bitstream from any FFmpeg compatible video codecs, requires FFmpeg to open input video files | Alec Carter ([source code](https://github.com/alectr0/VVConvert))
[Av1ador](https://github.com/porcino/Av1ador) | This program allows to encode VVC while transcoding by preview and comparison from original video, includes other encoders as well. | porcino

# FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)

Before you ask any question, see the questions below at table please.

| Question | Answer
--- | --- |
**1:** Are you the real creator of VVCEasy? | Yes... But I'm not a real creator of VVC; I didn't build VVC. It was Fraunhofer HHI that built VVC.
**2:** Are you trying to build VVCEasy? | Well, yes... it takes a longer time to make VVCEasy easier, but VVCEasy is not yet finished until further update announcements. I don't have employees, so I'm the only worker.
**3:** Is it okay to bring my proof screenshots of errors? | Yes, you can include error screenshots as proof. More proof, it's easier to solve.
**4:** My question is not listed on the FAQ. Can I ask you any questions? | Sure, go to the Issues tab, ask questions, and give me your issue. I'd be happy to solve it :).
**5:** Do you know what skills you have in your programming? | I know about batch files and HTML programming. Some programming languages might be difficult for me. Update of 19th February 2022: Perhaps I should create a C# Console program, which will support Windows, Mac, and Linux.

If you have any questions or/any issues, please go to the Issues tab and create your issue.
