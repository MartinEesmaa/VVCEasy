# Versatile Video Codec binaries

Versatile Video Codec binaries has available two tools for you to choose.

## Fraunhofer HHI (vvenc/vvdec)

Fraunhofer HHI VVC binaries is just standard easy tool, which allows to encode & decode with arguments and also encodes good quality for slow preset, but it may be slow...

* C++14 programming language
* Supports Windows, macOS, Linux, BSD, Android, iOS (library only with new app or non-signed binary executable on jailbroken device) & WebAssembly.
* SIMDE: SCALAR, SSE4.1, SSE4.2, AVX, AVX2, AVX512 (unsupported yet), NEON (arm only) and WASM (Web browsers only).
* Faster depends speeding up for newer computer machine of CPUs.
* Presets can be used from faster to slower.
* Includes advanced tool of encode (vvencFFapp)
* Two-pass control of bitrate is only allowed.
* Default encoding pixel format is 10-bit.
* For decoding, it can output to YUV, Y4M or pipe.
* Lossless encoding (only for vvencFFapp with CostMode argument)

## uvg266 (VVC Scalable encoder tool)

uvg266 is only scalable encoder which helps to make it faster for older & newer computers, but still a bit good quality than vvenc, seems okay.

* C99 programming language
* Supports Windows, macOS, Linux, BSD, Android & iOS (library only with new app or non-signed binary executable on jailbroken device).
* SIMDE: MMX, SSE, SSE2, SSE3, SSSE3, SSE4.1, SSE4.2, AVX, AVX2, NEON & AltiVec (PowerPC only).
* Can only encode 8-bit VVC output for rest operating system supported, but for 10-bit needs compiled with definition, this only works for Android users.
* Faster encoding scalable of old & new computers than vvenc.
* Supports presets from ultrafast to placebo like x264 presets, however it is recommended to use from faster to slower to avoid VVC decoding fail issue.
* Lossless encoding is not recommended due decoding fail.

### Minimum requirements

**vvenc/vvdec**:

- Windows XP and later (requires Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2019 installed)
- macOS 10.13 and later (arm64 since macOS 11.0)
- Linux kernel 3.2.0 and later (eg. Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and later)
- BSD (FreeBSD & x64 only)
- Android 4.1 (API 16, Jelly Bean) and later (arm64 & x86_64 since Android 5.0)

**uvg266**:

- Windows 7 and later (requires Visual C++ Redistributable, for Windows XP support needs [OneCoreAPI](https://github.com/shorthorn-project/One-Core-API-Binaries))
- macOS 10.13 and later (arm64 since macOS 11.0)
- Linux kernel 3.2.0 and later (eg. Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and later)
- BSD (FreeBSD & x64 only)
- Android 4.3 (API 18, Jelly Bean) and later (arm64 & x86_64 since Android 5.0)

### Downloads

NOTE: uvg266 compiled by same architectures supported of vvenc & vvdec.

All compiled builds are compressed files on 7-Zip.

## Comparisions between vvenc/vvdec and uvg266

If you're using newer computer or/and you wanted it to encode 10-bit with fast encoding to get good quality, use vvenc recommended.

If you're using older computer or/and more faster encoding of 8-bit than vvenc, use uvg266 recommended.

Also for decoding, use vvdec and also it is faster decoding for older (possible) & newer computers.
