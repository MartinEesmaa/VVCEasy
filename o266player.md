VLC Custom build of o266player only accepts to run 64-bit / x64 on your computer. 32-bit / x86 won't work.

This cannot be run on Windows Vista / Windows Server 2008 or older and Windows 8.0 to play VVC video file of VLC Custom build. 

Note: I'm trying to work it out of VLC 3.0.16.

Reminder: Some operating systems are working to load VVC video format in Virtual Machine softwares, but real machines will work every operating system, example Windows Server 2016 has already been tested by Tencent Cloud.

If your operating system is working to decode VVC video format like you're running on Windows 10, please fork this repository, edit README and make pull request of my original repository from your forked repository. Screenshot must be required winver and VLC Media Player (custom build of o266player)
